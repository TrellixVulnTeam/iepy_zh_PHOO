Virtualenv creation
-------------------

For organization sake, its strongly recommended to make all the IEPY
installation inside a virtual python environment.

We shouldn't be explaining how to create it here, so we wont.
There is way better documentation
`here <https://docs.python.org/3.4/library/venv.html>`__
for python 3.4.

Just make sure of have it created and activated while following the
IEPY installation instructions.
Some small notes before leading you to the good documentation:

 - If you are working with python3.3 (or 3.4 but with the buggy ubuntu/debian release),
   be warn that you will need to install *pip* by hand,
   as explained `here <http://pip.readthedocs.org/en/latest/installing.html#install-pip>`__
 - Alternatively, create your virtualenv with `virtualenvwrapper <http://virtualenvwrapper.readthedocs.org/en/latest/install.html#basic-installation>`_
